# NPWD App for ESX Garages

## Make sure to have the newest version of `esx_boat` and `esx_garage` with exports available.

## Install
1. Download the `npwd_esx_garage.zip` from releases. DO NOT CHANGE THE RESOURCE NAME. If you want to change it, you'll have to download the source code, alter `fetchNui.ts`, and building. Make sure you add the new name in step 5.
2. Unzip and add to your resources folder
3. Ensure `npwd_esx_garage` BEFORE `npwd`
